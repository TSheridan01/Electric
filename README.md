#### Electric vehicles are the future!

Electric vehicles (EVs) offer an opportunity to replace fossil fuels in the transport sector. Electrification of the transport sector can also bring benefits in terms of increased energy efficiency and reduced local pollution.

Cars and trucks produce nearly one-fifth of Americaâ€™s greenhouse-gas emissions, all of which must be eliminated to achieve the federal target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Although electric-vehicle (EV) sales in the United States have climbed by more than 40 percent each year, on average, since 2016, nearly half of US consumers say that battery or charging issues are their top concerns about buying EVs.

With major OEMs pledging to transition their fleets solely to the EV space over the coming years the need for new EV Charging Stations will be paramount. EV charging stations will replace all the gas stations we have come to know during our lives and will be our legacy. 

In addition this opens the door for an entire new sector of business, _investing and owning EV Charging Stations_. Our analysis pulls data from a multitude of sources; to factor in current EV Charging Stations and Crime Statistcs in New Jersey to help investors make smart decisions.
